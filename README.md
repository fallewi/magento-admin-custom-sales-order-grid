# Magento Admin Custom Sales Order Grid

This extension creates a new Sales Order Grid for the Magento Admin area. This will pull in a few other details like product names for orders to make searching for particular orders easier.


# Installation

To install this extension you only need to upload the files to the app directory, then log out of your Magento Admin and log back in.

> NOTE: If you stay logged in while installing an extension, sometimes you will receive an error. Simply log out and log back i to creat the new session.


# Digging Deeper

The original tutorial that I pulled the far majority of this code from is on  [Inchoo.net](http://inchoo.net/magento/how-to-create-a-custom-grid-from-scratch/).

> Note: I have changed over the plugin name and directory names from inchoo to smartgravity. I do encourage others that are looking to learn more about Magento extensions to do the same. The reason for doing this is that the Magento code structure is different than most CMS systems and going through this excercise requires you to check every instance and block of code. It will help you gain a greater understanding of what each bit of code is accomplishing.
