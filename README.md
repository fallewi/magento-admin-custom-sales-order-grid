# Magento Admin Custom Sales Order Grid

This extension creates a new Sales Order Grid for the Magento Admin area. This will pull in a few other details like product names for orders to make searching for particular orders easier.

**Tested on Magento 1.8.1.0, 1.9.0.1**

The original tutorial that I pulled this code from can be found here:

**[Inchoo.net - How to Create a Custom Grid From Scratch](http://inchoo.net/magento/how-to-create-a-custom-grid-from-scratch/)**.

> Note: I have changed over the plugin name and directory names from inchoo to smartgravity. I do encourage others that are looking to learn more about Magento extensions to change some aspects of tutorial samples. The reason for doing this is that the Magento code structure is different than most CMS systems and going through this excercise requires you to check every instance and block of code. It will help you gain a greater understanding of what each bit of code accomplishes.
